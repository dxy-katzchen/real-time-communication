## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Testing
```bash
# Quick test run
make test-quick

# Full test suite with coverage
make test

# CI-style testing
make ci-test

# Specific test categories
make test-unit
make test-socket
make test-integration
```

### Git Workflow
1. **Development**: Work on feature branches
2. **Testing**: `make test` before committing
3. **Pull Request**: Auto-validation via `pr-checks.yml`
4. **Review**: Coverage and test results in PR
5. **Merge**: Auto-deployment via `ci-cd.yml`
